//! Trait + impls for coercing a Python `Value` into a Rust type during
//! argument extraction.
//!
//! Companion to the `#[derive(FromArgs)]` macro in `monty-macros`. The derive
//! generates code that calls [`FromValue::extract_into`] for every positional
//! or keyword argument. The trait owns the cleanup of the input `Value` —
//! constrained impls drop the input, the identity impl for `Value` and the
//! owning [`StrArg`] keep it. Generated callers also need to drop
//! already-extracted owning fields on later error paths; for that they call
//! [`FromValue::drop_extracted`], which knows whether the extracted form holds
//! a heap reference.
//!
//! Failures are structured ([`FromValueFail`]) so the *kind* of failure is
//! reported by the impl rather than re-derived from error messages:
//! `WrongType` lets the extraction site pick CPython's wording, `Raise`
//! surfaces a fully-formed error unchanged.
