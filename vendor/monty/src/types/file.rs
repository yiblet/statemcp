//! Heap-backed Python file wrappers used by the `open()` builtin.
//!
//! Monty does not keep native file descriptors open inside the sandbox. These
//! objects store only the virtual path, requested mode, a small Python-visible
//! state such as `closed`, and (lazily) a heap-resident full-file buffer
//! populated on the first sized/line read or `seek()`. Each OS round-trip is a
//! complete one-shot [`OsFunctionCall`] operation, so host
//! filesystem access remains mediated by the same boundary used by
//! `pathlib.Path`.
//!
//! # Read / seek buffering
//!
//! The **first** read of any shape (bare `read()`, sized `read(N)`,
//! `readline`/`readlines`) or `seek()` triggers an `OsFunction::ReadText` /
//! `OsFunction::ReadBytes` call whose result is *stored* into the file's
//! [`OpenFile::buffer`] field instead of being pushed directly to the operand
//! stack; the per-call slice (everything-from-position for bare `read()`, the
//! requested N chars/bytes for sized reads, the next line for `readline`,
//! etc.) is computed from the now-loaded buffer and pushed in its place.
//! Subsequent reads and seeks slice that heap buffer in pure Monty with no
//! further OS calls. The buffer lives in the heap and counts against the
//! configured `max_memory`.
//!
//! A buffered read that *fails* in the host leaves the file in a retry-safe
//! state — `pending_read` is cleared, `buffer` stays empty, and `eof` is not
//! flipped — so user code that catches the exception and retries gets a
//! fresh attempt.
//!
//! `position` is the **char offset** in text mode (so `f.read(5)` advances
//! `position` by 5 chars regardless of byte width) and the **byte offset** in
//! binary mode. `tell()` returns this number — text-mode is therefore a
//! divergence from CPython, which returns an opaque byte cookie. See
//! `limitations/open.md` for the full divergence list.
//!
//! # Unsupported / diverging behavior
//!
//! The current implementation is a deliberate subset of CPython's file API.
//! Code that relies on the following will not behave the same way as on
//! CPython:
//!
//! - The context-manager protocol (`with open(...) as f:`) is supported but
//!   `__exit__` always returns `None` — it cannot suppress an in-flight
//!   exception. The file is closed on exit on both the success and exception
//!   paths.
//! - `+` update modes (`r+`, `w+`, `a+`, and their `b` variants) are
//!   rejected at parse time because Monty has no read-position tracking;
//!   without it a write after a read would silently truncate the file via
//!   the one-shot OS write.
//! - The `encoding`, `errors`, and `newline` arguments to `open()` are
//!   accepted only at their CPython defaults (with `encoding="utf-8"` as
//!   a documented no-op). Text I/O is whole-file UTF-8 with no error
//!   handlers or newline translation.
//! - Bytes paths are decoded as UTF-8 instead of using CPython's
//!   `os.fsdecode` / filesystem-encoding behavior.
//! - `tell()` in text mode returns a char index, not CPython's opaque byte
//!   cookie. Round-trips through `seek()` correctly.
//! - `seek(N)` in text mode accepts any char-index offset, where CPython
//!   restricts it to `seek(0)`, `seek(0, 2)`, or a cookie from `tell()`.
//! - `for line in f:` iteration is not implemented. Use `readlines()` and
//!   iterate the resulting list instead.
//!
//! Any code path that needs one of these should be added explicitly
//! rather than relying on CPython parity.
