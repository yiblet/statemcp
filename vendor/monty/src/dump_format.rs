//! Versioned framing for serialized interpreter state.
//!
//! A dump is one CBOR value — [`Dump`] — carrying both the interpreter
//! state and the session metadata a host must restore alongside it (script
//! name, type-check stubs), behind a `[MAGIC][DUMP_VERSION]` header. There is
//! exactly one dump shape, so hosts need no format knowledge beyond [`dump`]
//! and [`Dump::load`]; whether the session was idle or suspended is the
//! [`Session`] discriminant, not a separate tag.
//!
//! # Naming contract
//!
//! The payload is self-describing: structs are maps keyed by field name and
//! enums are keyed by variant name, so serde's derive evolves the schema on
//! its own. A dumped type may gain a field with `#[serde(default)]`, lose a
//! field, or have variants inserted anywhere, and older dumps still load.
//! Tuple structs and tuple variants are positional, so their fields may only
//! be appended.
//! The names themselves are the contract: renaming a serialized field or
//! variant needs `#[serde(alias = "old")]` (or a [`DUMP_VERSION`] bump), and
//! `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` must never be added to a dumped type.
