//! Recursion-depth tracking for the [`VM`].
//!
//! The recursion counter lives on the `VM` (not the heap) because every site
//! that charges depth — function-call frames, container `repr`/`eq`/`cmp`/`hash`,
//! `isinstance`, json encoding — has a `&mut VM` in scope. Two primitives charge
//! a level:
//!
//! - [`VM::recursion_guard`] for lexically-scoped recursion: an RAII guard that
//!   derefs to the VM and releases the level on drop (every path, incl. `?`).
//! - [`VM::incr_recursion`] for reservations that must outlive a lexical scope —
//!   notably the container iterators, which store the [`RecursionToken`] so the
//!   bound is owned by the iterator and a caller cannot forget to charge it.
//!
//! A stored token can't be released through the heap alone (the heap has no path
//! back to the VM counter), so its [`DropWithContext`] impl is bound by
//! [`ContainsVM`] rather than [`ContainsHeap`], and it is cleaned up through the
//! same `defer_drop!` machinery as any other value.
