The core interpreter crate of [Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) — a secure Python sandbox written in Rust for code written by AI.

Monty runs Python code written by an LLM without the cost, latency and complexity of a container based sandbox. It parses Python with [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)'s parser and executes it on its own bytecode VM — no CPython, no FFI, no C dependencies. Startup takes microseconds, not hundreds of milliseconds.

This crate runs the interpreter in your own process, so an abort inside it (a stack overflow, an allocator failure) takes your process with it. For untrusted code use [`monty-pool`](https://crates.io/crates/monty-pool), which runs the interpreter in worker subprocesses and replaces one that crashes.

The sandbox has no ambient access to the host: filesystem, environment and network are only reachable through external function calls and mounts that you explicitly provide.

This crate is the pure-Rust core. Most users want one of the bindings built on top of it:

- **Python**: [`pydantic-monty`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-monty/)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: [`@pydantic/monty`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pydantic/monty)
- **CLI**: the `monty` binary from the [`monty-runtime`](https://crates.io/crates/monty-runtime) crate

See the [documentation](https://pydantic.dev/docs/monty/) for the motivation, latency measurements, comparison to alternatives and the supported Python subset.

## Basic usage

`MontyRun` parses and compiles code once; `run` executes it with input values and returns the value of the final expression as a `MontyObject`:

```rust
use monty::MontyRun;
use monty_types::{CompileOptions, ResourceTracker, MontyObject, PrintWriter, ResourceLimits};

let code = r#"
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

fib(x)
"#;

let mut runner = MontyRun::new(code.to_owned(), "fib.py", vec!["x".to_owned()], CompileOptions::default()).unwrap();
let result = runner.run(vec![MontyObject::int(10)], ResourceTracker::default(), PrintWriter::Stdout).unwrap();
assert_eq!(result, MontyObject::int(55));
```

`CompileOptions` also carries `source_scan_threshold`, the source length in bytes above which a pre-parse nesting scan runs (4 KiB by default); the docs' language limitations page describes the scan.

Errors are returned as `MontyException`, with a traceback matching what CPython would produce. `PrintWriter` controls where `print()` output goes: `Stdout`, `Disabled`, or collected for the host to inspect — into a `String`, or into a `CollectedStreams` buffer whose `entries()` label each run `stdout` or `stderr`.

## Resource limits

Untrusted code shouldn't be able to hog the host. `ResourceTracker` enforces execution-time and recursion limits and configures GC scheduling. Memory limits additionally require `monty-alloc` as the executable's global allocator.

Hosts enforce `max_suspensions`: count answered suspensions, then call `abort` on `FunctionCall`, `OsCall`, `NameLookup`, or `ResolveFutures` at the first excess. The supplied exception bypasses sandbox exception handlers:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use monty::MontyRun;
use monty_types::{CompileOptions, ResourceTracker, PrintWriter, ResourceLimits};

let limits = ResourceLimits {
    max_feed_duration: Some(Duration::from_millis(20)),
    ..ResourceLimits::default()
};

let mut runner = MontyRun::new("while True: pass".to_owned(), "spin.py", vec![], CompileOptions::default()).unwrap();
let err = runner.run(vec![], ResourceTracker::new(limits), PrintWriter::Stdout).unwrap_err();
assert!(err.to_string().contains("feed time limit exceeded"));
```

## External functions and snapshotting

The defining feature of the crate: instead of running to completion, `MontyRun::start` returns a `RunProgress` that pauses execution whenever the sandboxed code calls a function provided by the host. The host runs the real function (an API call, a database query, an LLM tool) and resumes with the result:

```rust
use monty::{MontyRun, RunProgress};
use monty_types::{CompileOptions, ResourceTracker, MontyObject, PrintWriter, ResourceLimits};

let code = "data = get_data(3)\ndata * 2";
let runner = MontyRun::new(code.to_owned(), "main.py", vec!["get_data".to_owned()], CompileOptions::default()).unwrap();

// pass the external function in as an input
let get_data = MontyObject::function("get_data".to_owned(), None);
let progress = runner.start(vec![get_data], ResourceTracker::default(), PrintWriter::Stdout).unwrap();

// execution pauses at the `get_data(3)` call
let RunProgress::FunctionCall(call) = progress else { panic!("expected a function call") };
assert_eq!(call.function_name, "get_data");
assert_eq!(call.args.arg(0).unwrap(), MontyObject::int(3));

// the host computes the result and resumes
let progress = call.resume(MontyObject::int(21), PrintWriter::Stdout).unwrap();
let RunProgress::Complete(result) = progress else { panic!("expected completion") };
assert_eq!(result, MontyObject::int(42));
```

A REPL session is a self-contained snapshot of the interpreter: serialize it with `dump()`, store it in a file or database, and `Dump::load()` + keep feeding it later — in a different process or on a different machine. The dump carries the session metadata (script name, type-check stubs) alongside the state, behind a version this build checks on load:

```rust
use monty::{Dump, MontyRepl, Session, SessionRef, dump};
use monty_types::{CompileOptions, MontyObject, PrintWriter, ResourceTracker};

let mut repl = MontyRepl::new("main.py", ResourceTracker::default(), CompileOptions::default());
repl.feed_run("x = 41", vec![], PrintWriter::Stdout).unwrap();
let bytes = dump("main.py", None, SessionRef::Idle(&repl)).unwrap();

// later, restore and carry on feeding
let Session::Idle(mut restored) = Dump::load(&bytes).unwrap().state else {
    panic!("expected an idle session")
};
let result = restored.feed_run("x + 1", vec![], PrintWriter::Stdout).unwrap();
assert_eq!(result, MontyObject::int(42));
```

`MontyRun` and `RunProgress` have no dump format of their own, but both implement `serde::Serialize`/`Deserialize`, so a host that wants to cache compiled code or a paused run can serialize them with whatever format it already uses.

For both `Dump::load` and direct serde deserialization, the caller must establish that the bytes are unmodified output from a trusted, compatible Monty producer.
Monty does not authenticate snapshots or fully validate their contents.
Invalid snapshots have no correctness or availability guarantees: loading or using them may panic, abort, hang, or produce incorrect results.
Successful decoding is not evidence of authenticity or validity.

Async host functions are supported too: `FunctionCall::resume_pending` continues execution with a pending future the sandboxed code can `await`; when all tasks are blocked, execution yields `RunProgress::ResolveFutures` for the host to supply results. When `FunctionCall::allow_eager_await` is true the call is awaited immediately and no other task can run, so a host that already has the result can pass it to `FunctionCall::resume_eager` and skip the `ResolveFutures` round trip. `OsCall::allow_eager_await` says the same of an `asyncio.sleep` the host has already waited out.

## Other pieces

- `MontyRepl` — a REPL-style interface: feed code snippet by snippet with state persisting between snippets.
- `monty-fs` crate — mount real host directories into the sandbox at virtual paths (read-write, read-only, or copy-on-write in-memory overlay), with path resolution hardened against escapes.
- `RunProgress::OsCall` — filesystem and other `os`-level operations the host can intercept or delegate.
- `FunctionCall::object_id` and `NameLookup::object_id` identify the host receiver for routed calls and lookups,
  including class construction via `__call__`.
  Plain calls and lookups carry `None`.
- Every suspension carries a `SourceRange` (`FunctionCall::position`, `OsCall::position`, `NameLookup::position`,
  `ResolveFutures::position()`) locating the suspending expression: the call, the name, or the `await` the main task is
  blocked on.
- `MontyRun::with_os_policy` / `MontyRepl::with_os_policy` configure clocks, sleeps and initial random state on every
  execution path.
  `DateTimeSource` selects the system clock, a fixed instant or the host; `SandboxTimeZone` independently selects UTC, a
  fixed offset and name, or an IANA zone (`SandboxTimeZone::named`, resolved from the tz database that `monty-types`'
  `tzdb` or `tzdb-bundled` feature provides).
  `SleepMode` selects capped system sleeps, a host handler or no wait; `RandomStart` selects OS entropy, a seed with
  `random.seed()` semantics or host entropy.
  Defaults use the system clock, UTC and OS entropy, with sleeps capped at ten seconds.
  System sleeps suspend for the host to wait without its `os` handler; standard execution waits inline.
  `CallHost` delegates to the host through `RunProgress::OsCall`.
